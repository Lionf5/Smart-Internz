# IPYNB files for Training of our Detection model
This repository contains the IPYNB files used for training our 3 kinds of Detection models. The training process involved utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and employing a diverse dataset for training, validation, and testing purposes.

* Our models take an image as input and predicts its belonging to one of the various classes such as damaged/not damaged, front/rear/side, mild/moderate/severe.

Through this repository, we showcase our professional approach in training these models, leveraging advanced techniques and datasets to achieve reliable results in all 3 detection models.
