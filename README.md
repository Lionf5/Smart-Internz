## Running of Flask Application

Steps for running the Flask Application is mentioned in the `./Project/Flask_app/` directory

## Training of models and Datasets

The IPYNB files for training the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in all three models ofdamage estimation, along with other specifications and details can be found in the `./Project/IPYNB Files/` directory.

By accessing these IPYNB files, users can gain insights into the training process, model architecture, and evaluation metrics employed for both Emotion and Sign Language Detection. Additionally, the associated *Datasets* utilized for training these models are also included.
